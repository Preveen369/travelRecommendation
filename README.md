# Travel Recommendation
Travel Recommendation is a static web application that assists users in discovering personalized travel destinations based on their preferences, such as interests, budget, and travel season. It leverages mock API data from a local JSON file to generate dynamic suggestions, complete with destination details, images, and itineraries, all powered by vanilla web technologies for instant, offline access.

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to land on the recommendation form.
2. Fill in preferences like travel type, budget, and dates, then submit to trigger the recommendation engine.
3. The app parses the `travel_recommendation.apijson` file to match and display tailored destinations.
4. Click on a suggestion to view detailed itineraries or explore more options.
5. All processing happens client-side for fast, private results—no servers needed.
